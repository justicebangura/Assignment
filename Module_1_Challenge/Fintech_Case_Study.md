## Overview and Origin

* Neo Financial is a Canadian fintech company located in Calgary, Alberta.

* Neo was incorporated on October 1st, 2019.

* Neo Financial was founded by Andrew Chau, Jeff Adamson, and Kris Read as a digital alternative to traditional banking.

* Neo was created after Andrew and Jeff both experienced success in the Canadian start-up world, co-founding SkipTheDishes in 2012.

* Neo Financial has raised $235.8M in funding over six rounds. Their latest funding round (Series C) happened on May 5th, 2022.

## Business Activities

* Neo Financial seeks to revolutionize the traditional banking model by addressing pain points such as complex processes, fees, and lack of modern features in today's banking world.

* Neo Financial intends to serve the generation of millennials and Canadians who are unhappy with the service they receive from traditional banks. "Every year, more than five million Canadians — roughly the population of Toronto make service complaints against their banks."

* Neo provides banking solutions such as lower interest rates and more transparency around customer fees. As a fintech company, Neo utilizes technology to create a better banking experience and platform that challenges the traditional banking sphere.

* "Neo Financial utilizes 17 technology products and services like HTML5, jQuery, and Google Analytics, according to G2 Stack, and they are actively using 57 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith". Neo uses out-of-the-box AWS services that seamlessly work together to create a modern architecture using serverless components that save time and reduce cost. Using scalable AWS services for its entire event allows each service to scale up and down with demand.

## Landscape

* Neo is in the Personal Finance, digital banking, and deposits domain.

* Over the last 5–10 years. This domain has seen a growth in the adaptation of online and mobile banking and has also seen an increase in the use of contactless payment and personal banking apps that often use AI to advise customers on budgeting and saving.

* In this fintech domain, other competitors of Neo Financial include Koho, Mogo, NorthOne, and Wealthsimple.

## Results

* Neo Financial is one of the best digital banks(Neobanks). As a fintech company, they save money on operating costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar banks, resulting in better banking interest rates and cash-back rewards for customers.

* Some of the core metrics or key performance metrics (KPI) for companies in this fintech domain include but are not limited to User growth rate, Number of active users, Customer acquisition cost, Customer Lifetime Value, and more! Despite being a successful fintech company valued at over 1 billion dollars, Neo Financial still struggles with low user rates, especially for its flagship credit card, And this could be due to high customer acquisition costs in Canada.

* Neo Financial has a  higher interest rate on savings, a better rate on cash back, more partner merchants, and integrated investing and mortgage platforms than others.  

## Recommendations

* One advice I would give Neo Financial would be to recommend they improve their customer support system by introducing an AI-driven, humanoid Chatbot(Voice) system. Being a fully digital banking platform without a physical location can create issues with customer experience.

* This humanoid (chatbot) service will help Neo improve customer retention and satisfaction and reduce customer acquisition costs.

* This service will use technologies like API, Python, chatbot and other language models, Machine learning, Voice(speech) Synthesis, and more.

* Using API will allow an AI chatbot and other language models to connect to the Neo platform. We will use Python to create the development environment. With Machine Learning, we can specialize this new humanoid chatbot in the digital banking/investment domain, and via voice synthesis and speech recognition, it can communicate as a customer service expert.
